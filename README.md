# AVRsack

`AVRsack` is an integrated development environment for the Atmel AVR series of microcontrollers. 
It is designed to be an alternative for the Arduino 1.0.x application, offering:

* A more powerful text editor with a variety of styles.</li>
* A more powerful build system with incremental rebuilds.</li>
* A more powerful upload system with finer grained control over logging.</li>
* Full build/upload logs without arbitrary size restrictions.</li>
* Support for handling multiple simultaneous serial ports.</li>
* Support for assembly programming and disassembly of object code.</li>
* Support for alternate AVR toolchains, such as [Crosspack-AVR](https://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html)

`AVRsack` was written and designed by Matthias Neeracher <microtherion@gmail.com>

For editing text, `AVRsack` relies on Michael Robinson's [ACEView](https://github.com/faceleg/ACEView), 
a Cocoa wrapper for the [Ace](http://ace.c9.io) code editor.
